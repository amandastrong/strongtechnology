				<h1> HIPAA Compliance: </h1>
					<p>With HIPAA’s Final Omnibus Rule now in full effect, all businesses that create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI) are obligated to comply with the HIPAA Security Rule.  Medical and Dental providers, along with their Business Associates, are required to have policies and procedures in place that address the new security requirements as well as conduct periodic Security Risk Assessments. </p>

					<p>As a HIPAA Compliant Business Associate, Strong Technology Consulting can assist you in becoming and remain HIPAA complaint by helping you create Security Policies and Procedures, providing comprehensive training for your staff, and conducting your periodic Security Risk Assessment.</p>
